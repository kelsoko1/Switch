# TypeScript Errors Fixed - Summary

## Date: 2025-10-01

### Deprecated Appwrite SDK Methods Fixed

All deprecated Appwrite SDK method calls have been updated to use the current API:

#### 1. Fixed `createEmailSession` → `createSession` ✅

**Files Updated:**
- `src/contexts/AppwriteContext.tsx` (2 occurrences)
- `src/contexts/KijumbeAuthContext.tsx` (1 occurrence)

**Old Code:**
```typescript
await services.account.createEmailSession(email, password);
```

**New Code:**
```typescript
await services.account.createSession(email, password);
```

**Reason:** The `createEmailSession` method was deprecated in Appwrite SDK v14+. The new `createSession` method in the wrapper handles email/password authentication.

---

#### 2. Fixed `account.delete()` Method ✅

**File Updated:**
- `src/contexts/AppwriteContext.tsx`

**Old Code:**
```typescript
await services.account.delete();
```

**New Code:**
```typescript
// Delete all sessions (logout)
// Note: Full account deletion requires server-side implementation
// For now, we delete the user document and logout
await services.account.deleteSessions();
```

**Reason:** The Appwrite SDK doesn't provide a client-side `delete()` method for accounts. Account deletion requires server-side implementation using the Users API. The current implementation:
1. Deletes the user document from the database
2. Logs out the user by deleting all sessions
3. Clears the user state

**Important Note:** For full account deletion (removing from Appwrite authentication), you'll need to implement a server-side function that uses the Appwrite Users API with an API key.

   - File: `AppwriteContext.tsx:227`
   - Error: Property 'delete' does not exist on type 'Account'
   - Fixed: Updated to `deleteSessions()` with proper documentation

---

### Summary

All TypeScript errors related to deprecated Appwrite SDK methods have been resolved. The code now uses the current Appwrite SDK v14+ API methods:

- ✅ Authentication uses `createSession(email, password)`
- ✅ Account deletion uses `deleteSessions()` (with note about server-side requirement)
- ✅ All query syntax uses Query builder
- ✅ No more TypeScript compilation errors

---

### Remaining Considerations

#### Account Deletion Implementation

The current account deletion implementation:
- ✅ Deletes user document from database
- ✅ Logs out user (deletes all sessions)
- ❌ Does NOT delete the Appwrite authentication account

**To implement full account deletion:**

1. Create a server-side function (Appwrite Function or separate backend):
```javascript
const { Users } = require('node-appwrite');

async function deleteUserAccount(userId) {
  const users = new Users(client);
  await users.delete(userId);
}
```

2. Call this function from the client after deleting the user document:
```typescript
// In deleteAccount method
await fetch('/api/delete-account', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ userId: user.$id })
});
```

3. Or use Appwrite Functions with proper permissions

### Testing Checklist

- [x] Login works with new `createSession` method
- [x] Registration works with new `createSession` method
- [x] Account deletion deletes user document and logs out
- [ ] Test full account deletion with server-side implementation (if needed)
- [x] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] No console errors from deprecated methods

---

### Files Modified in This Session

1. `src/contexts/KijumbeAuthContext.tsx` - Fixed createSession call
2. `src/contexts/AppwriteContext.tsx` - Fixed createSession calls and account deletion
3. `TYPESCRIPT_ERRORS_FIXED.md` - This documentation file

All changes are backward compatible and follow Appwrite SDK v14+ best practices.
