# 🎉 Kijumbe Wallet Integration Setup Guide

## ✅ Integration Complete!

The Kijumbe project has been successfully integrated as a financial service card within the unified wallet system. Here's what's been implemented:

### 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
Unified Wallet System
├── Main Wallet Balance (All services share same balance)
├── Service Cards:
│   ├── 🟢 Kijumbe Savings (Rotational savings groups)
│   ├── 🔵 Utility Payments (Electricity, Water, Internet)
│   ├── 🟣 Money Transfers (Mobile Money, Bank Transfer)
│   ├── 🟠 Transportation (Dala Dala, Taxi, Boda Boda)
│   └── 🟦 Investments (Stocks, Real Estate)
└── Unified Transaction History
```

### 📁 Files Created/Modified

**New Files:**
- `src/contexts/KijumbeAuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced authentication with roles
- `src/components/wallet/KijumbeServiceCard.tsx` - Kijumbe as service card
- `src/components/KijumbeTest.tsx` - Test component for Kijumbe integration
- `src/pages/wallet/WalletDashboard.tsx` - Unified wallet page

**Modified Files:**
- `src/App.tsx` - Added KijumbeAuthProvider and routes
- `src/lib/appwrite.ts` - Added unified appwrite export

### 🚀 How to Test

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Kijumbe Authentication:**
   - Visit `/test/kijumbe`
   - Register with different roles (Member, Kiongozi, Admin)
   - Test login/logout functionality

3. **Test Unified Wallet:**
   - Visit `/wallet` (requires authentication)
   - See unified balance and service cards
   - Test Kijumbe service features

### 🔧 Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with your Appwrite credentials:

```env
# Appwrite Configuration
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=kijumbe-database

# Collection IDs (optional - defaults provided)
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_USERS_ID=users
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_WALLETS_ID=wallets
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_TRANSACTIONS_ID=transactions
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_SAVINGS_GOALS_ID=savings_goals
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_GROUPS_ID=groups
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_GROUP_MEMBERS_ID=group_members
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_CONTRIBUTIONS_ID=contributions
```

### 🗄️ Database Setup

You'll need to create these collections in your Appwrite database:

1. **users** - User accounts with roles
2. **wallets** - User wallet information
3. **transactions** - All wallet transactions
4. **savings_goals** - Kijumbe savings goals
5. **groups** - Rotational savings groups
6. **group_members** - Group membership
7. **contributions** - Group contributions

### 🎯 Key Features

**Unified Wallet:**
- ✅ Single balance for all financial services
