# Vite Migration Complete

The Kijumbe webapp has been successfully migrated from Create React App to Vite with the latest Appwrite integration.

## What Changed

### 1. Build System
- **Old**: Create React App with `react-scripts`
- **New**: Vite with modern build tools
- **Benefits**: Faster development server, faster builds, modern ES modules

### 2. Appwrite Integration
- **Updated to**: Appwrite v17.0.0 (latest)
- **Added**: Pink Icons integration for modern UI
- **Enhanced**: Better error handling and modern client setup

### 3. Environment Variables
- **Old**: `REACT_APP_*` prefixes
- **New**: `VITE_*` prefixes
- **Migration**: All environment variables have been updated

### 4. Styling
- **Updated**: Tailwind CSS v4 with Vite integration
- **Added**: Modern design system from Appwrite starter
- **Enhanced**: Better typography with Inter and Poppins fonts

## Development Commands

### Start Development Server
```bash
# Option 1: Use the new Vite-specific script
start-vite.bat

# Option 2: Manual start
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Build for Production
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

### Lint Code
```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
```

## Environment Setup

1. Copy the environment example:
   ```bash
   cp frontend/env.example frontend/.env
   ```

2. Update the environment variables with your Appwrite configuration:
   ```
   VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
   VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_NAME=your_project_name
   ```

## Important Notes

- The frontend now runs on port **3001** (was 3000)
- Backend continues to run on port **3000**
- All API calls are proxied through Vite's dev server
- The build output is optimized and smaller than before
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is faster and more reliable

✅ **Modern Appwrite**: Latest v17 with improved features  
✅ **Better UI**: Pink Icons and modern design system
