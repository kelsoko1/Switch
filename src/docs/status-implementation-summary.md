# Status Feature Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Integrated Status Feature with Appwrite**
   - Updated the `StatusManager` class to work with Appwrite for storing and retrieving statuses
   - Added support for storing status media in Appwrite Storage
   - Implemented proper error handling and type safety

2. **Made Status Feature Only Visible in Chat Interface**
   - Added the `StatusArea` component to the `ChatList` component
   - Ensured statuses are only displayed in the chat section of the app

3. **Enhanced Status Data Structure**
   - Added support for captions in status updates
   - Implemented proper status expiration (24 hours)
   - Added status view tracking

4. **Added Infrastructure**
   - Created constants for collections and storage buckets
   - Created an initialization script to set up required Appwrite collections and buckets
   - Added npm script for easy setup: `npm run appwrite:init-status`

5. **Provided Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation for the status feature
   - Documented data structures, components, and usage

## How to Use the Status Feature

1. **Setup**
   - Run `npm run appwrite:init-status` to create the necessary Appwrite collections and buckets

2. **Creating Statuses**
   - Click "Add to your status" in the chat interface
   - Upload a photo or video, or enter text
   - Add an optional caption
   - Post the status

3. **Viewing Statuses**
   - Statuses appear in a horizontal scrollable list at the top of the chat interface
   - Click on a status to view it in full screen
   - Status views are tracked

## Technical Details

- **Storage**: Media files are stored in the `status_media` bucket
- **Database**: Status metadata is stored in the `status_updates` collection
- **Views**: Status views are tracked in the `status_views` collection
- **Expiration**: Statuses automatically expire after 24 hours

## Next Steps

To fully complete the implementation, consider:

1. Adding automated cleanup for expired statuses
2. Implementing status replies and reactions
3. Adding more media options (filters, effects, etc.)
4. Enhancing the UI with animations and transitions
