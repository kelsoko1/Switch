# Next Steps for KijumbeSmart Deployment

## Issue Fixed

The Nginx configuration has been fixed to work without SSL certificates initially. This resolves the error:

```
cannot load certificate "/etc/letsencrypt/live/kijumbesmart.co.tz/fullchain.pem": BIO_new_file() failed
```

## How to Proceed

1. **Run the quick-fix script** to apply the fixes to your current deployment:
   ```bash
   sudo ./quick-fix.sh
   ```

2. **Verify that the application is running** on HTTP:
   ```bash
   curl -I http://kijumbesmart.co.tz
   ```

3. **Set up SSL** after the application is running and the domain is properly configured:
   ```bash
   sudo ./setup-ssl.sh
   ```

- **health-check.sh**: Script to check the health of the application

## Deployment Process

The updated deployment process is:

1. Install dependencies
2. Configure environment variables
3. Build the application
4. Set up PM2
5. Configure Nginx for HTTP
6. Start the application
7. Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt
8. Set up cron jobs for monitoring and backups

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Domain Not Configured

If the domain is not yet configured to point to your server:

1. Deploy with HTTP only
2. Wait for DNS propagation
3. Set up SSL after the domain is properly configured

### SSL Certificate Issues

If Let's Encrypt fails to issue certificates:

1. Make sure the domain is accessible via HTTP
2. Check that ports 80 and 443 are open
3. Try the setup-ssl.sh script again after resolving any issues

### Application Not Starting

If the application doesn't start:

1. Check PM2 logs: `pm2 logs kijumbesmart-app`
2. Verify environment variables: `cat server/.env`
3. Make sure port 2025 is not in use: `netstat -tuln | grep 2025`

## Monitoring

The application is monitored using:

1. PM2 for process monitoring
2. Cron jobs for automatic restarts
3. Health check script for comprehensive status reports

Run the health check at any time:
```bash
sudo ./health-check.sh
```
